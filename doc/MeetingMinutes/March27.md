# Meeting Minutes

Date: March 27, 2024

## Participants:
- Christian Eddie
- Jenny Su
- Colton Schneider
- Jason Zhai

## Discussion:
- For the last few days before the deadline, make sure to be almost done to have time to fine tune everything
- Demo is in 2 weeks
- For the Demo, we must all be there for the entire lab
- Demo is 4 minutes, not very much time. Choose best features to demo to not go over 4 minutes
- For the demo, choose one device and maybe 1 phone and rehearse based on these devices, this device must have HDMI support
- If you want, come to the lab early to rehearse with the projector
- Hindle will probably ask functional questions as opposed to technical questions
- Demo should be non technical, as if we are presenting to buisiness students for example
- The demo will be weighed very heavily
- Hindle is very particular, don't underestimate the demo
- If something is not working, don't demo it, focus on best features
- The demo is probably ~8 of the 20 marks for part 4
- We will meet for the technical parts, the demo is just showing functionality
- For our meeting, don't waste time on UML or anything like that, focus on the application, test cases, ect.
- We should have events already created before the demo, our database should be populated with real or realistic events before hand
- If you have any questions ask Raquib on the chat

## To Dos:
- Try to be mostly done functionality before the next lab
