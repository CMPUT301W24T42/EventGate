# Meeting Minutes

Date: February 28, 2024

## Participants:
- Christian Eddie
- Jason Zhai
- Jenny Su

## Discussion:
Discussion about part 2:
  - CRC cards are pretty good, some classes have a lot of responsibilites, might need to be split up.
  - Backlog is good, keep updating the backlog as we continue working. Raquib will check this randomly for part 3 (tool use). He will also check pull requests, commit messages, ect.
  - UI mockups, 1 point deducted. Missing a couple screenshots. Very bare minimum. Background changes from white to blue. Too many user stories covered by one screenshot.

Warning for part 3, our github doesn't have much activity so far, 0 pull requests, few commits.
Code quality: There should be header comments, javadocs.
In part 3 we don't need to do anything beyond what we promised for the halfway checkpoint.

## To Dos:
In part 3, address feedback:
  - Work on UI mockups, add a few more screenshots, include them in story board sequencing.
  - There should be headers to know where you are. Look at examples Raquib sent for part 2.
  - Some buttons are off center.
  - Raquib will be more particular for part 3.

If we need anything reviewed or more feedback, message Raquib before March 6 11:59pm. This is the informal deadline for asking for feedback.
Raquib will be more particular, so don't hesitate to ask for feedback.
Be diligent with the project requirements, if anything is missing it will be a huge deduction. Eg. UML missing.
Write test cases before deadline, at least one of two days before the deadline.
