# Meeting Minutes

Date: March 20, 2024

## Participants:
- Christian Eddie
- Jenny Su
- Colton Schneider
- Jason Zhai

## Discussion:
- Grading for part 3 was posted - Expecting the same for part 4
- We showed a lot of functionality in part 3 - Keep doing what you're doing
- UML is low priority - Make updates for formality
- Improve the UI for part 4
- Common mistake from part 3:
    - A change for one user should be visible to other users, ie. Deleted event as admin should be deleted for Organizer and Attendees
- The demo for part 4 will be ~10 minutes, make sure to show all functionality and anything cool or additional work done
- Using multiple devices for the demo is great

## To Dos:
- Work on part 4
- 5 User stories each
- Deadline for part 4 is April 8th, make sure all questions or requests for feedback are sent to Raquib by April 6th
